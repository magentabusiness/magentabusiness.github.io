## IoT Hub services

IoT Hub is designed to be:

* **scalable**: horizontally scalable platform, build using leading open-source technologies.
* **fault-tolerant**: no single-point-of-failure, every node in the cluster is identical.
* **robust and efficient**: single server node can handle tens or even hundreds thousands of devices depending on use-case. 
IoT Hub cluster can handle millions of devices.
* **durable**: never lose your data. IoT Hub supports various queue implementations to provide extremely high message durability.
* **customizable**: adding new functionality is easy with customizable widgets and rule engine nodes.


The diagram below shows key system components and interfaces they provide. Let's walk through them.

**IoT Hub Transports**
{% assign docsPrefix = "pe/" %} 
IoT Hub provides [MQTT](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}reference/mqtt-api/), [HTTP](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}reference/http-api/), [CoAP](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}reference/coap-api/) and [LwM2M](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}reference/lwm2m-api/) based APIs that are available for your device applications/firmware. 
Each of the protocol APIs are provided by a separate server component and is part of IoT Hub "Transport Layer". 
MQTT Transport also provides [Gateway APIs](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}reference/gateway-mqtt-api/) to be used by gateways that represent multiple connected devices and/or sensors.

Once the Transport receives the message from device, it is parsed and pushed to durable [Message Queue](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}reference/#message-queues-are-awesome). 
The message delivery is acknowledged to device only after corresponding message is acknowledged by the message queue.

**IoT Hub Core**

IoT Hub Core is responsible for handling [REST API](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}reference/rest-api/) calls and WebSocket [subscriptions](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/telemetry/#websocket-api).
It is also responsible for storing up to date information about active device sessions and monitoring device [connectivity state](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/device-connectivity-status/).
IoT Hub Core uses Actor System under the hood to implement actors for main entities: tenants and devices. 
Platform nodes can join the cluster, where each node is responsible for certain partitions of the incoming messages.

**IoT Hub Rule Engine**

IoT Hub Rule Engine is the heart of the system and is responsible for processing incoming [messages](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-0/overview/#rule-engine-message).
Rule Engine uses Actor System under the hood to implement actors for main entities: rule chains and rule nodes.
Rule Engine nodes can join the cluster, where each node is responsible for certain partitions of the incoming messages.

Rule Engine subscribes to incoming data feed from queue(s) and acknowledge the message only once it is processed. 
There are multiple strategies available that control the order or message processing and the criteria of message acknowledgement.
See [submit strategies](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-5/queues/#queue-submit-strategy) and [processing strategies](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-5/queues/#queue-processing-strategy)
for more details.

IoT Hub Rule Engine may operate in two modes: shared and isolated. In shared mode, rule engine process messages that belong to multiple tenants.
In isolated mode Rule Engine may be configured to process messages for tenants of specific tenant profile only.

**IoT Hub Web UI**

IoT Hub provides a lightweight component written using Express.js framework to host static web ui content. 
Those components are completely stateless and no much configuration available. 
The static web UI contains application bundle. Once it is loaded, the application starts using the REST API and WebSockets API provided by IoT Hub Core.  
 
## IoT Hub message queues

IoT Hub supports two types of message queues: **Kafka** and **In-Memory**.
- **Kafka** is a widely used, distributed, and durable message queue system designed to handle large volumes of data. It is well-suited for production environments where high throughput, fault tolerance, and scalability are critical.
- **In-Memory** queue is a lightweight, fast, and simple message queue implementation designed for testing, smaller-scale or development environments. It stores messages in memory rather than on disk, prioritizing speed over persistence.

Using durable and scalable Kafka queue allow IoT Hub to implement back-pressure and load balancing. Back-pressure is extremely important in case of peak loads.
We provide "abstraction layer" over specific queue implementations and maintain two main concepts: topic and topic partition. 
One topic may have configurable number of partitions. Since most of the queue implementations does not support partitions, we use *topic + "." + partition* pattern.
  
IoT Hub message Producers determines which partition to use based on the hash of entity id. 
Thus, all messages for the same entity are always pushed to the same partition.
IoT Hub message Consumers coordinate using Zookeeper and use consistent-hash algorithm to determine list of partitions that each Consumer should subscribe to.
While running in microservices mode, each service also has the dedicated "Notifications" topic based on the unique service id that has only one partition.      
   
IoT Hub uses following topics:

 * **tb_transport.api.requests**: to send generic API calls to check device credentials from Transport to IoT Hub Core.
 * **tb_transport.api.responses**: to receive device credentials verification results from IoT Hub Core to Transport.
 * **tb_core**: to push messages from Transport or Rule Engine to IoT Hub Core. Messages include session lifecycle events, attribute and RPC subscriptions, etc.
 * **tb_rule_engine**: to push messages from Transport or IoT Hub Core to Rule Engine. Messages include incoming telemetry, device states, entity lifecycle events, etc.

Since IoT Hub 3.4 we can configure Rule Engine queues by the UI, see the [documentation](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/rule-engine-2-5/queues/){:target="_blank"}.

**Note:** Starting version 2.5 we have switched from using [gRPC](https://grpc.io/){:target="_blank"} to [Message Queues](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}reference/#thingsboard-message-queues)
for all communication between IoT Hub components. 
The main idea was to sacrifice small performance/latency penalties in favor of persistent and reliable message delivery and automatic load balancing.

<!-- ## On-premise vs cloud deployments

IoT Hub supports both on-premise and cloud deployments. 
With more then 5000 IoT Hub servers running all over the world, IoT Hub is running in production on AWS, Azure, GCE and private data centers.
It is possible to launch IoT Hub in the private network with no internet access at all. -->

<!-- ## Standalone vs cluster mode

Platform is designed to be horizontally scalable and supports automatic discovery of new IoT Hub servers (nodes). 
All IoT Hub nodes inside cluster are identical and are sharing the load. 
Since all nodes are identical there is no "master" or "coordinator" processes and there is no single point of failure. 
The load balancer of your choice may forward request from devices, applications and users to all IoT Hub nodes.

## Monolithic vs microservices architecture

Starting IoT Hub v2.2, it is possible to run the platform as a monolithic application or as a set of microservices. 
Supporting both options requires some additional programming efforts, however, is critical due to back-ward compatibility with variety of existing installations.

Approximately 80% of the platform installations are still using monolithic mode due to minimum support efforts, knowledge and hardware resources to do the setup and low maintenance efforts.

However, if you do need high availability or would like to scale to millions of devices, then microservices is a way to go.
There are also some challenges that are solved with microservices architecture and applicable for more complex deployments and usage scenarios. 
For example, running a multi-tenant deployments where one need more granular isolation to protect from:

* unpredictable load spikes;
* unpredictable rule chain misconfiguration;
* single devices opening 1000s of concurrent connections due to firmware bugs;
* and many other cases.

## SQL vs NoSQL vs Hybrid database approach

IoT Hub uses database to store 
[entities](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/entities-and-relations/) (devices, assets, customers, dashboards, etc) and 
[telemetry](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}user-guide/telemetry/) data (attributes, timeseries sensor readings, statistics, events). 
Platform supports three database options at the moment:

* **SQL** - Stores all entities and telemetry in SQL database. IoT Hub authors recommend to use PostgreSQL and this is the main SQL database that IoT Hub supports. 
It is possible to use HSQLDB for local development purposes. **We do not recommend to use HSQLDB** for anything except running tests and launching dev instance that has minimum possible load.
* **Hybrid (PostgreSQL + Cassandra)** - Stores all entities in PostgreSQL database and timeseries data in Cassandra database. 
* **Hybrid (PostgreSQL + TimescaleDB)** - Stores all entities in PostgreSQL database and timeseries data in Timescale database. 

```yaml
database:
  ts_max_intervals: "${DATABASE_TS_MAX_INTERVALS:700}" # Max number of DB queries generated by single API call to fetch telemetry records
  ts:
    type: "${DATABASE_TS_TYPE:sql}" # cassandra, sql, or timescale (for hybrid mode, DATABASE_TS_TYPE value should be cassandra, or timescale)
  ts_latest:
    type: "${DATABASE_TS_LATEST_TYPE:sql}" # cassandra, sql, or timescale (for hybrid mode, DATABASE_TS_TYPE value should be cassandra, or timescale)

```

## Programming languages and third-party

IoT Hub back-end is written in Java, but we also have some micro-services based on Node.js. IoT Hub front-end is a SPA based on Angular 9 framework. 
<!-- See [monolithic](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}reference/monolithic) and [microservices](/docs/{{docsPrefix}}reference/monolithic) pages for more details about third-party components used.   -->

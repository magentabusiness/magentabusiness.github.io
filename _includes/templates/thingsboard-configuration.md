## IoT Hub configuration

**Note** IoT Hub configuration steps are necessary only in case of **local IoT Hub installation**.
If you are using [**Live Demo**](https://iothub.magenta.at/) instance all entities are pre-configured for your demo account.
However, we recommend reviewing this steps because you will still need to get device access token to send requests to IoT Hub.

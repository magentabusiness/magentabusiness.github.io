Launch windows shell (Command Prompt) as Administrator. Change directory to your IoT Hub Edge installation directory.

Execute **install.bat** script to install IoT Hub Edge as a Windows service.
This means it will be automatically started on system startup. 
Similar, **uninstall.bat** will remove IoT Hub Edge from Windows services.

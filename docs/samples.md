#### Demo Account

IoT Hub installation contains **[single tenant account](/docs/samples/demo-account/)** that is used in sample applications and contains a lot of pre-provisioned entities for demonstration purposes.

#### Hardware platforms

The IoT Hub samples are grouped by hardware platform.

**Note** IoT Hub provides hardware independent APIs.
If your device platform is not in the list, but is able to setup HTTP, CoAP or MQTT connections - it is possible to integrate it with IoT Hub.
IoT Hub team is working on samples applications for
Intel Edison, C.H.I.P, Tessel, Samsung Artik and Gemalto 
and will upload them to this page as soon as possible.

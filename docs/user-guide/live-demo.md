Live Demo is a single-node server that is deployed to simplify the process of getting started with the IoT Hub platform.

You can access the demo server using the following URL [**iothub.magenta.at**](https://iothub.magenta.at/signup)
You will need to populate the sign-up form and as a result, you will receive tenant administrator account for your dedicated tenant.

Once you have logged in you will receive access to all dashboards and devices that are used in IoT Hub [**samples**](/docs/samples/).
